Here’s a recap of what I’ve worked on and released in 2010:

###[Youtube Fraiche](https://github.com/capotej/youtube_fraiche)

I couldn’t find a youtube downloader that worked on github, so I wrote my own one evening

###[Uploadd](https://github.com/capotej/uploadd) and [paperclip_uploadd](https://github.com/capotej/paperclip_uploadd)
I wanted to upload and store images off-site (using paperclip/rails) on an server which has cheaper bandwidth rates than S3. Using rainbows, this tiny rack script has handled over a 1.5 million uploads at a peak of 10-15 uploads/sec. Also, it’s been running for about 6 months now without a single crash. Thank you Eric Wong!
There is also a plugin for the popular paperclip gem to use uploadd as a storage backend transparently.

###[mrskinner](https://github.com/capotej/mrskinner/blob/master/mrskinner.js)

Tiny javascript for making the site gutters clickable based on a fixed width layout

###[existential](https://github.com/capotej/existential)

Completely inspired by Nick Kallen’s [post](http://pivotallabs.com/users/nick/blog/articles/272-access-control-permissions-in-rails) on authorization, I wanted to extract that pattern into a rails plugin that I could use for all my projects. I use devise/existential for all my projects now.

###[has_opengraph](https://github.com/capotej/has_opengraph)

Easy way to participate in opengraph and draw facebook like buttons. Just annotate your models with meta data, and draw it in your view easily.

###[chewbacca](https://github.com/capotej/chewbacca)

I kinda feel bad that I took a cool name for such a lame script. Anyway it’s a set of rake tasks that provide a hair of abstraction above scp. Useful when you have a set of files locally that map to a different set of files remotely.



I already have tons of stuff in the works for 2011!
