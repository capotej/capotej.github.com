While looking for a way to add wunderlist tasks via alfred, I came upon this: [http://jdfwarrior.tumblr.com/post/13163220116/wunderlist-for-alfred](http://jdfwarrior.tumblr.com/post/13163220116/wunderlist-for-alfred) 

Looked cool, but I wanted to write my own that didn't depend on php.

I used*lsof*to figure out the location of the db, then used*file*to see what kind of db it was. Luckily, it was sqlite3, so I was able to poke around and figure out the sql to create a task.

Here's the alfred extenstion that ties it all together:

`user=`whoami`
wunderdb="/Users/$user/Library/Wunderlist/wunderlist.db"
sqlite3 $wunderdb "insert into tasks (name, list_id) values ('{query}', 1)"`
